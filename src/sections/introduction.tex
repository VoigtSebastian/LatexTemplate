\subsection{Using a Glossary}

When using technical language, one an define a word using a glossary.
For example, \gls{yaml} is used to describe complex data-structures in
a human-readable format.

In addition, this glossary entry is an acronym, so there is a definition for
the acronym \gls{yaml} and the explanation of it \gls{yaml} in the glossary.
They get separated into different sections automatically.

The usage of \quotes{first} in \gls{yaml} defines the form of the glossary entry on
first usage.

The glossary, seen in \cref{lst:glossary}, is defined at glossary/glossary.tex.

\lstinputlisting[
    language=tex,
    caption={The glossary file},
    label=lst:glossary]{glossary/glossary.tex}
